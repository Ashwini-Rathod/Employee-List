# Employee-List
The page displays the employee list for a particular company. The data is fetched by making an API call and then rendered on the DOM.
This page uses Asynchronous JavaScript mechanisms to fetch the detials of all the employees. The details of the employees are generated for dummy purpose. API call is made to fetch the data of the employees using 'Axios'. 

JavaScript is a single threaded programming language. Asynchronous JavaScript mechanism performs long network requests without blocking the main thread. Asynchronous callbacks are used to make the flow work in a non blocking mode.

In this page, the data of the employees is fetched using async and await methods. It returns a promise. The promise contains the data of all the employees. Once the data is fetched, a function is written which renders the employee data on the DOM in the form of tiles for each employee.
